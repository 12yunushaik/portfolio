			Thankyou for showing interest, 
			here is a quick story of me and
			this website. My programming 
			journey started  in 2023, 
           <u> I started my batchelors in Electrical 
            and Electronics engineering at vasavi
            college of engineering back in 2020.</u>
            I had intrest in programming before 
            I had joined my batchelors and then
            I didnt give much time for programming 
            just caring about my own stream and by 
            the time I reached my final year I again
            got intrest in programming and
            I started my programming practice.
     		I like coding all kind of problems 
			from the very basic like adding 
			numbers to the complex ones like
			competitive programming problems.
			I love making projects and games.
			Infact this website is one of my 
			Web Development Projects which 
			is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
			<br>Languages known : C++ Language, 
			 Python, Java, 
			MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data 
			Structures and Algorithm, OOP, 
			HTML, CSS.

			<h2 style="color: brown;">Rock Paper Scissor </h2>
            <p>
                Rock-paper-scissors is just plain fun! It's easy to play,
keeps us entertained, and helps us make decisions in a
lighthearted way. Whether we're goofing off with friends
or settling a dispute, it's a game that always brings a
smile to our faces.
